PyAFIP
======

PyAFIP is a basic python library for accesing some of AFIP's web services, and
currently a work in progress.

See the files in test/ for examples. These are *not* test units, but rather
files to manually test funcionality.

Requirements
------------

Due to dependency incompatibilities, PyAFIP only works with Python 2.7. You'll
also require:

* [m2crypto][https://github.com/martinpaljak/M2Crypto]
* [lxml][http://lxml.de/]
* [suds][https://fedorahosted.org/suds/]
